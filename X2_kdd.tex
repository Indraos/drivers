\chapter{Complete Earnings Information for DiDi Platform Drivers}
In this brief appendix, we reproduce payment information for platform drivers and describes more concretely the decision environment for the Reinforcement Learning agent in the KDD 2020 Callenge. 

\section{Payment Information for Drivers}


\section{Decision Environment for Reinforcement Learning Agents}
Here, we describe the exact state and action spaces for Reinforcement Learning agents in the KDD 2020 challenge.
