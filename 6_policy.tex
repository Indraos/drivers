\chapter{Conclusion and Policy Implications}\label{chap:policy}
This thesis studied the relevance and optimal design of information provided to ridesourcing drivers. \autoref{chap:jakarta} showed that besides earnings maximization, drivers also take into account cultural and infromational considerations in their labor supply decisions. \autoref{chap:chengdu} showed that there are high potential earnings gains from additional information. We then went on to study commitment and privacy of messages as two challenges. In this last chapter, we consider three stakeholder groups, platforms, regulators and transportation engineers with policy recommendations and additional complications arising out of this work. 
\section{The Commitment Challenge for Platforms}
We observed in \autoref{chap:infodesign} that the limited commitment of the platform to providing different platform can lead to not information being transmitted and we proposed reputation 
\section{The Fairness Challenge for Transportation Regulators}
\section{Challenges for Transportation Engineers}
The above two challenges give interesting challenges for transportation engineers.
