	The information design problem has
a literal interpretation: there
really is an information designer (or mediator, or sender) who can commit to provide extra information to players to serve her own
interests. While the commitment assumption may be problematic in many settings, it provides a useful benchmark.---\tocite (Bergemann-Morris)

In this section, we propose an information design model to highlight some incentives regarding ridesourcing. We will assume a monopolistic platform, and an uncertain demand function, as well as a mass of drivers. 
\section{Model}
We study a very stylized model with two players, one area. Agents can decide to either drive into this area or not. The game that agents play is given by

We assume two ways in which the platform can communicate the information to the drivers.
\subsection{Cheap Talk}
In cheap talk, the platform discloses some information to a driver, which, given the update, updates their behavior. More concretely, there is an abstract set of \emph{messages} $m \in \mathcal M$ that the platform can send. The players receive the message and play optimally. In particular, the timeline of the game is:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The demand at the area is realized.
	\item The platform decides to send a message to the drivers.
	\item The drivers decide to drive to the area or not.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Information Design}
In information design, the drivers can commit to a driver
